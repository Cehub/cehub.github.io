China will launch three new free-trade zones on Tuesday (21 Apr). The free-trade zones (FTZs) will be opened in the southern province of Guangdong, the northern port of Tianjin and the eastern province of Fujian, reported the website of the People’s Daily, the ruling Communist Party’s mouthpiece.
The Guangdong FTZ aims to speed economic integration with neighbouring Hong Kong. The Fujian zone is focused on Taiwan, which China considers part of its sovereign territory, and aims to become a “cooperation platform” for the “21st century maritime silk road”. The Tianjin FTZ is part of a push to better integrate the city with nearby Beijing and Hebei province, according to the State Council.
