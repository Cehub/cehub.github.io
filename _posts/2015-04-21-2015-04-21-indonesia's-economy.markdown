Indonesians have good reason to be upbeat about their future. Despite volatile commodity and financial markets, the nation’s GDP has been growing at 5% to 6% for a decade. The number of well-off Indonesian households should reach 140 million in the next decade. Indonesia has the advantage of being the top economy in one of the world’s most dynamic regions – Southeast Asia. Combined, the ten ASEAN economies more than tripled in size between 2003 and 2013.
