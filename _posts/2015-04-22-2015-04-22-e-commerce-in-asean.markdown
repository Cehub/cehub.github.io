Ecommerce law is two to five years old in most ASEAN countries, but best established in Singapore and Malaysia according to an A. T. Kearney report. Transport networks are not only strong in these two countries but also in Thailand, whereas it is quite a challenge in other countries offering an opportunity to focus and innovate in this area. Foreign ownership in Indonesia and Vietnam can also be complicated and needs further research.
