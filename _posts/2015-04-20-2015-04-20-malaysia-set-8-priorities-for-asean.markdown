Malaysia's statement at the 26th Asean Summit will outline some eight priorities for the 10-member bloc, including the establishment of the Asean Community by year-end, Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman said.
He said that other priorities included developing the Asean Community's post-2015 vision, steering Asean closer to the people and strengthening the development of small and medium entrepreneurs (SME) in the region of some 633 million people.
