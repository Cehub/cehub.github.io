The ASEAN Master Plan for Connectivity (AMPC) and China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative  are highly convergent in their interests of developing transport connectivity facilitating better access for trade, capital flows, tourism and human capital exchanges. This requires a system of roads and railways to link contiguous ASEAN countries and maritime infrastructure for RoRo (roll-on roll-off) vessels linking maritime and mainland Southeast Asia.
The 7000 km-Singapore-Kunming Rail Link (SKRL) with ASEAN’s railway connectivity plans seems to be a key part, given the deal between Thailand and China covering railway construction and agricultural products.
